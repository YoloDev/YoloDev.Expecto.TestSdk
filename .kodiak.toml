# `update.require_automerge_label = false`.
#
# When enabled, _Kodiak will not be able to efficiently update PRs._ If you have
# multiple PRs against a target like `master`, any time a commit is added to
# `master` _all_ of those PRs against `master` will update. For `N` PRs against
# a target you will see at least `N(N-1)/2` updates. If this configuration
# option was disabled you would only see at least `N-1` updates.
